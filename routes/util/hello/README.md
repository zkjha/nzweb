This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
well as how to make oneway and batched invocations.

To run the demo, first you need to start an Ice hello server from
another language mapping (Java, C++, C#, or Python). Please refer to
the README in the server subdirectory for more information on starting
the server.

After starting the server, open a separate window and start the
client:

      node Client.js

To test timeouts you can use 'T' to set a timeout on the client proxy
and 'P' to set a delayed response in the server to cause a timeout.
You will notice that two "Hello World!" messages will be printed by
the server in this case. This is because the sayHello method is marked
as idempotent in the slice, meaning that Ice does not need to follow
the at-most-once retry semantics. See the manual for more information
about retry behavior.
